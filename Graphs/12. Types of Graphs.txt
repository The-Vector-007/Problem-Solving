There are two more types of graphs :-

(1) Directed Graph - In these graphs, the edges are one way only.

code:-

    adjMatrix[i][j] = 1; // no need to store adjMatrix[j][i] = 1

(2) Weighted Graph - In these graphs, the edges have some weight on them.

code :-

So, instead of  adjMatrix[i][j] = 1 we will put the corresponding weight i.e. adjMatrix[i][j] = weight.

NOTE :-

The DFS and BFS will remain same for directed graphs.

For weighted graphs, we can check adjMatrix[vertex1][vertex2] >= 0 for an edge to be present and -1 for no edge.
