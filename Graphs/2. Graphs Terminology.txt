(1) Adjacent vertices - If two vertices have a direct edge between them then they are called Adjacent vertices.

(2) Degree - No of edges passing through a vertex is called its degree.

(3) Path - collection of edges through which one can reach from one vertex to other.

(4) Connected Graph - A graph is called connected if , for any two vertices in that graph there exists a path.

(5) Connected Components - The whole graph is not connected but some parts of it are connected , these parts are called Connected
Components.
Note - A single isolated vertex will also be counted as a connected Component.

(6) Tree - connected graph which does not have a cycle.

Let n be the no of vertices in a graph. Then,

Minimum no of edges = 0

Minimum no of edges in connected graph = n - 1 ( this is same for a tree as well ) 
( connected but no cycle )

Number of edges in a complete graph( each vertex is connected with every other vertex ) = n choose 2 or nC2 = n(n-1)/2

In a connected graph, if your algorithm depends upon no of edges then it can vary from O(n) to O(n^2).
