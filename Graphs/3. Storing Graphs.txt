There are three ways of storing graphs :-

(1) Edge list - Store all the vertices and all edges. ( Least efficient )

(2) Adjacency List - For each vertex, we store its corresponding vertices which are connected to it.

(3) Adjacency Matrix - We create a matrix of n x n ( n being the total vertices ). Each (i,j) value representing whether the two 
vertices have an edge or not.

The disadvantage of Adjacency matrix is that it requires O(n^2) space and if the graph is a sparse graph ( having very less edges )
then a lot of space is wasted. 

The easiest method to store a graph is Adjacency matrix and more commmonly used as well.
