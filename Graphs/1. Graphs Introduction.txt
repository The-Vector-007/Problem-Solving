A graph consists of a set of vertices connected with each other through a set of vertices.

A tree is a special type of graph.

A tree has two proprties which makes it different from a graph :-
(1) All the nodes are connected with each other in such a way that there always exists a path from one node to other.
(2) A tree doesn't have any cycles i.e it is acyclic
