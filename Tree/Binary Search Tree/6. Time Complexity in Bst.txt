Commonly performed operations on binary search tree are:-

(1) Search Operation
(2) Insertion Operation
(3) Deletion Operation

Time Complexity :-

- Time complexity of all BST Operations = O(h).
- Here, h = Height of binary search tree

In worst case,

The binary search tree is a skewed binary search tree. 1
Height of the binary search tree becomes n.             \
So, Time complexity of BST Operations = O(n).            2

							   3
						            \
							     4

In best case,

The binary search tree is a balanced binary search tree.			
Height of the binary search tree becomes log(n).
So, Time complexity of BST Operations = O(logn).
