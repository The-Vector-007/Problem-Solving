Heaps follows two Major Properties :-

(1) Complete Binary Tree
(2) Heap Order Property

Complete Binary Tree:-

In a complete Binary Tree, all levels must be filled except the last one, it should be filled from left to right.( you need to take
care of this when inserting and deleting an element. )

Heap Order Property :-

Heaps are of two types - (1) Min Heap (2) Max Heap

So, the heap order property is also of two types (i.e one for each) :-

(a) Min Heap order property - In the whole CBT , each parent node must have value smaller than its left and right children.

e.g :-                  1

                    2       3
                
                4      5 6      7

            8

(2) Max Heap order property - In the whole CBT, each parent node must have value greater than its left and right children.

e.g :-                  8

                    7       6

                5      4 3     2
