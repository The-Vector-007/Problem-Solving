Priority Queues can be best implemented with a Balanced BST.

The Time Complexity for the basic operations like Insert, Delete & Access element becomes O(logn).

But we have to keep the tree balanced which will cost some extra time.

So, a new data structure will be used to implement priority Queues that is a Heap!

Priority Queues are of two types :-

(1) Min Heap Priority Queue - element having minimum priority is important.
(2) Max Heap Priority Queue - element having maximum priority is important.
