Every number can be expressed as a product of prime numbers.

                                    N = p1^a * p2^b * p3^c *...* pn^k

This is also known as the prime factorization of that number.

If we know the prime factorization of a number we can calculate the no of divisors of that number.

                    Total Divisors = (a+1) * (b+1) * (c+1) *...* (k+1)

E.g  24 = 2^3 * 3^1, divisors = (3+1) * (1+1) = 4 * 2 = 8 i.e. 1 2 3 4 6 8 12 24
     10 = 2^1 * 5^1, divisors = (1+1) * (1+1) = 2 * 2 = 4 i.e. 1 2 5 10

Problem Statement : We will be given a number n, count the no of divisors of n!.

Solution : Find prime factorization of n! and use the above formula, BUT we will use a different technique to find prime factorization
of n!.

e.g : prime factorization of 4!

We know, 
            4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24

The prime factors of 24 lies in the range [1,4] i.e. 2 ,3

Now for each prime factor we need to find its greates power which can divide 24.

e.g: For p = 2,
                4 x 3 x 2 x 1 / 2 ^ x, x = greatest power of 2 which divides 24

It can be found  through legendre's formula ( It provides greatest power of x which divides n! ).

legendre formula = [n/p] + [n/p^2] + [n/p^3] +...+ [n/p^k] , where p^k <= n, [] - floor

So for p = 2 and n = 4,

                        x = [4/2] + [4/4] = 2 + 1 = 3

Therefore, x = 3 is the greatest exponent of 2 which divides 4! i.e. 24.

To solve the given problem keep these things in mind :-

(1) Find prime numbers in the range [1,n] because these much prime numbers are sufficient to write prime factorization of n!.
(2) Find the greatest exponent of each prime number using Legendre's Formula.
