-A point and vector can be used as synonym in Computational Geometry.

    A vector AB can be represented as :-

    A = (x1,y1) <-- w.r.t origin            B = (x2,y2) <-- w.r.t origin

            AB = (x2-x1, y2-y1) <-- A vector is represented by a single point in Computational Geometry.  
            BA = (x1-x2, y1-y2)

    E.G :-

    A point (or vector) = (1,1)
    B point (or vector) = (4,4)

    AB vector = (4-1, 4-1) = (3,3)
    BA vector = (1-4, 1-4) = (-3,-3)

-Addition of two vectors :-

    AB = (x1,y1)    PQ = (x2,y2)

    AB + PQ = (x1+x2, y1+y2) <-- Add corresponding values

-Dot Product :-

    AB = (x1,x2)    PQ = (y1,y2)

    AB . PQ = (x1 * y1) + (x2 * y2) 

-Cross Product :-

    AB = (x1,x2)    PQ = (y1,y2)

    AB x PQ = (x1 * y2) - (x2 * y1)

-Application of cross product :-

    A x B = |A|.|B|.SinÎ¸

    Area of Parallelogram formed by two vector A and B is given by their cross product.

    Area of Parallelogram = A x B = |A x B| = | x1 * y2 - x2 * y1 | <-- Only magnitude

    Area of Triangle = (A x B)/2 = |A x B|/2 = | x1 * y2 - x2 * y1 |/2
