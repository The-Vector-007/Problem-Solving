There are two methods for collision handling :-

(1) Closed Hashing (Separate chaining)
(2) Open Addressing 

(1) Closed Hashing or separate chaining => In this method we will have a linked list for each index in our array, so that when two 
different keys come to the same index through the hash function we can store them in the linked list.

(2) Open Addressing => In this method when a collision occurs,  we try to fing a alternative so that the second key can be send to some
other index.

                                        (h base i)(a) = hf(a) + f(i)
                                        new hash value = original hash value + alternative

There are multiple techniques used, some are :-

(1) Linear probing => f(i) = i
(2) Quadratic probing => f(i) = i^2
(3) Double hashing => f(i) = i * h'(a)  ( h'(a) -- new hash function )
